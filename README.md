# Express GraphQL API 

## Installation

Get this repository on your machine by cloning it!

```
git clone https://github.com/nananananate/express-graphql-demo
```

Navigate into the repository.

```
cd express-graphql-demo
```

Now install the dependencies needed.  
If you're curious on what the dependencies are, we explain them later.

```
npm install
```

You are now ready to run the demo!

## Running the app

For learning purposes, there are two apps (or servers) that you can run!

The basic server runs ONLY by using this command:

```
node server-basic
```

With `server-basic` being the name of the file holding our basic server, `server-basic.js`.

The more advanced app can be run with this command:

```
node server
```



## Dependencies

These dependencies are installed when you run `npm install`, but let's explain why we use them! 

### `express`

Express is a Node.js web framework, typically used for a back-end web app. And if you know back-end, you know that you'll be making a Web API!

### `graphQL`

### `express-graphql`.
